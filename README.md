## Functionality

TropiCall Contact Manager allows all users to perform quick and intuitive operations to manage all of their contacts. Inline edit, add, and delete contact operations, along with a dynamically loaded table complete the basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) requirements. Regex matching ensures that contact emails and phone numbers are valid, and contact/user information is stored securely in a remote database.
